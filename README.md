## IMPORTANT NOTE
For an unknown reason, tweeter did not approve my request for the dev key. This frustrating situation leads me to abandon this project.

# ChallengersTracker
This app will automatically track new participants to the CSharpChallenge, list them and their projects and extract other important metadata.
The c# coding challenge was initiated by Tim in January 2022

## Roadmap
  1. Create an empty console application
  2. Install Tweetinvi package from nuget
  3. Create model and database context
  4. Implement the tweets search app
  5. Parse tweets to extract challengers and projects metadata
  6. Save data to a local database
  7. Improve UI with a web application in the same solution
  8. Automate the process of tweets searching and parsing
  9. Allow application users to comment a particular project tweet from the legacy application
  10. Host the final project on a dummy domain
